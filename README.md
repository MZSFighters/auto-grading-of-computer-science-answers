# Semi-Automated Grading of Free-Text Computer Science Answers

The code and results for each component of the semi-automated pipeline are organised into their respective folders:
- Fine-tuning (Embeddings)
- Clustering
- Sampling

Most of the code can be executed using the provided Python files, as long as the file paths are correctly maintained within the existing folder structure.

**Note:** Some parts of the code cannot be run because the bert_epoch_48 and gpt2_epoch_50 models are not included in this repository. This is due to GitHub's file size limitations, as the model tensors are too large to store here.
